This project helps realise the real intution behind matrices , determinants, eigen values ,
eigen vectors and what they sound in the real world. it also explains the existance of complex 
and imaginary eigen values and eigen vectors.

This repository contains multiple sub directories representing actively updated series. The former version visualises
simply how the given matrix manipulatex the space.
The later versions includes changing the domain of the sample space (change of bases vectors) , 
simultaneos visualisation of pointwise and grid wise transformations. which can explain the concepts like canonical form.

The output dynamically plots the eigen values of the input vectors,provided they are real

All versions support the output to be saved as mp4 file
